# Testing for Frontend Development

## Testing Frameworks

- **Jest/Vitest**: I will be focusing on Vitest as I already prefer to use Vite over creat-react-app.
- **React testing library**: Not sure if I'll be needing this on top of Jest/Vitest, _more research needed_.
- **Cypress/Puppeteer**: Will focus on Cypress since it has a larger community, but I do want to
  at least look into Puppeteer and see what it's good points are.
